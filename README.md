# Email Classification: Spam or Ham

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying emails into spam or ham (non-spam) categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models. The model leverages advanced preprocessing techniques to ensure high accuracy and efficiency in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.

## Repository Structure

- *dl-model-nlp-imp.ipynb*: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation of the spam mail classification model.

## Motivation

With the increasing volume of email communication, distinguishing spam from legitimate emails has become crucial. Spam emails can be not only annoying but also harmful, posing security threats such as phishing attacks. This project aims to provide an effective solution to automatically filter out spam emails, enhancing the overall email experience and security.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project comprises labeled emails categorized as spam or ham. Each email undergoes extensive preprocessing to transform it into a format suitable for model training.

## Preprocessing Techniques

1. *Tokenization*: Breaking down the email text into individual words or tokens.
2. *Lemmatization*: Using SpaCy, words are reduced to their base or root form.
3. *Stop Words Removal*: Commonly used words (e.g., "the", "is", "in") that do not contribute significantly to the model's understanding are removed.
4. *Vectorization*: Converting text data into numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer.

## Model Architecture

The preprocessed text data is fed into a deep learning model designed to classify emails with high accuracy. The model architecture is fine-tuned to handle the complexities of natural language and to capture subtle differences between spam and legitimate emails.

## Results

The model demonstrates a high level of accuracy in classifying emails as spam or ham. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are provided in the notebook.

## Future Work

- *Model Optimization*: Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to further improve accuracy.
- *Real-time Deployment*: Develop an API to integrate the model into email systems for real-time spam detection.
- *Enhanced Preprocessing*: Explore additional NLP techniques to enhance text preprocessing.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of NLP and deep learning in tackling the challenge of email spam classification. By leveraging advanced preprocessing techniques and a robust model architecture, it provides an effective solution for identifying spam emails, contributing to a safer and more efficient email communication environment.
